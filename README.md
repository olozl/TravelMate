### Description 
TravelMate is an open source private-travel-guide-matching app for your reliable and satisfiable trip with a private guide. Anyone can be a travelmate(guide) and a traveler(user). TravelMate provides a place for people to find their travelmate and/or traveler at any time and place they want to look around. Both travelers and travelmates can offer their availabilities and money trade is made through the app.

My friend, Sejoong Kim, brought up with this idea from Uber and AirBnB where people share their own properties. I degined up to implement TravelMate like an open-market shopping cart based on Android. 

### To Run
1. Clone Repository
2. Install Android Studio 2.3.3 and make sure jdk to be installed in your device.
3. Open Android Studio and open TravelMate that you cloned from the github repository.
4. Build the application and run it using the emulator. (I emulated on Nexus 6 API 25)
5. Start exploring!
