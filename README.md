### Description 
TravelMate is a travel guide matching app for your reliable and satisfiable trip. Anyone can be a travelmate(guide) and a traveler(user). TravelMate provides a place for people to find their travelmate and/or traveler at any time and place they want to look around. Both travelers and travelmates can offer their availabilities and money trade is made through the app. # My friend, Sejoong Kim, brought up with this idea from Uber and AirBnB where people share their own properties. I degined up to implement TravelMate like an open-market shopping cart based on Android.
