### Current Features
week 3 - TravelMate will be created on Android and is to find a personal guide who is not professional. My friend, Sejoong Kim, got this idea from Uber and AirBnB where "anyone" can be a driver/homeowner and a user at the same time. TravelMate provides a place for people to find a guide and to find their guests for a satisfying travel/trip. I designed up to implement TravleMate like a open-market shopping cart. So, I am working on implementing it based on shopping cart open-source and will add features for unique features.
